## Overview
This is a simple password generator tool implemented in Python. It generates random passwords of specified lengths and evaluates their strength based on their length.

## How to Use
1. Run the script `main.py`.
2. Enter the desired length of the password when prompted.
3. The script will generate a random password of the specified length and display it along with its strength.
